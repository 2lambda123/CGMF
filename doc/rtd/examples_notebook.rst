Examples of Jupyter Notebook
============================

`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`_ notebooks offer very powerful and easy to use capabilities to analyze the raw output file of CGMF runs. Below are some examples of notebooks that analyze particular aspects of the prompt neutron and gamma data calculated by :program:`CGMF`.
