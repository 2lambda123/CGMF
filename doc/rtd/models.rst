Physics Models Implemented in CGMF
==================================

CGMF implements the Hauser-Fesbach theory of statistical nuclear reactions applied to the de-excitation of the fragments produced in a binary fission reaction. It uses the Monte Carlo approach to produce an event-by-event view of the process, following each sampled decay path exactly, i.e., conserving energy, spin and parity as the excitation energy is released through the emission of neutrons and photons. To perform this calculation, several physics models have been incorporated into CGMF, as well as input parameter and/or input data. Those are discussed in this Section.
